Canterbury Homekill Starts either with the slaughter of your animal or we can take it deceased.</p>

<p>For CHK to be able to take your animal you must either:</p>

<ul class="no-bullet stripes">
    <li>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="small-12 columns">
                have been actively involved in the day to day maintenance of the animal, including providing for the physical, health and behavaioral needs of the animal for at least 28 days;
            </div>
        </div>
    </li>
            
    <li>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="small-12 columns second-background">
                Or a farmer of animals of this kind.
            </div>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="small-12 columns">        
                Or wild game - which you do not need to be actively involved with.
            </div>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
