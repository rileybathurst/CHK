Things to do

- small menu

- what is the site map? it doesnt have an extension
- one step at a time do the php files first then dive deep in gutenberg pages incase I change up the plans I'll still need better css
- js to fix the animals if one is on hover the other part should be too
- flag banner I think has to be a single tag so that it can be a gutenberg style
